# Set Solver

I got really frustrated playing [this game](http://setgame.ath.cx/), so I decided to solve it. Just copy and paste the contents `set-solver.js` into the console when you have a game open, and you should be...set.

This could definitely be optimized, but there's no real need to, since the board is fairly small.
